Bugs:
* data seems to be missing rows (data are only from 2010). We may need to re-run data_prep to include all seasons.


To Do:
* By 2/10: Update alldata.RDS with all seasons available. 
            Run all of baseballstat.R 
            Run stat_analysis.R
* NOT A BUG: we need to decide on analyses of the stat.
* NOT A BUG: we need to consider how to visualize the stat.
